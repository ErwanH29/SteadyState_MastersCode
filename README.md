# SteadyState_BH
Code using [AMUSE](https://amuse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which looks at simulating intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) clusters, testing their stability in an attempt to investigate whether IMBH mergers could help explain the formation of super massive black holes.

* code/: Consists of all the codes used in the project.
* misc/: Consists the Mikkola code along with a triple system centered (and bridged) with SMBH
