# SteadyState_BH
Code using [AMUSE](https://amuse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which looks at simulating intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) clusters, testing their stability in an attempt to investigate whether IMBH mergers could help explain the formation of super massive black holes.

To run the code, run interface.py while being in the SteadyState_BH/Code directory.

- Code/ is for local computer run and testing script. 
- ALICE_Codes/ is code manipulated to fit ALICE requirements
- Data\_Process/ helps plot ALICE results, whose output is a different configuration than those run under local device.
- misc/ is various codes used to make random plots to gain intuition
