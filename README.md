# SteadyState_BH
Code using [AMUSE](https://amuse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which looks at simulating intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) clusters, testing their stability in an attempt to investigate whether IMBH mergers could help explain the formation of super massive black holes.

To run the code, run interface.py while being in the SteadyState_BH/Code directory.

Code under Code/ is for local computer run. Code under ALICE_Codes is those manipulated to fit ALICE requirements and includes both simulations with and without GC.

ALICE\_Comp\_Scripts helps plot ALICE results, whose output is a different configuration than those run under local device.
