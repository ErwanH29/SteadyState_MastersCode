# SteadyState_BH
Code using [AMUSE](https://amuse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which looks at simulating intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) clusters, testing their stability in an attempt to investigate whether IMBH mergers could help explain the formation of super massive black holes.

To run the code, run interface.py while being in the SteadyState_BH/Code directory.

- GRX_Code/ is for local computer run and adopts the GRX formulation. To run, have your environment in the directory and run interface.py
- Data\_Process/ helps plot results.
- misc/ contains various codes used to make plots of observations, initial conditions or general intuition.
